# About aws-mwaa-local-runner

This repository provides a command line interface (CLI) utility that replicates an Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) environment locally.

## About the CLI

The CLI builds a Docker container image locally thatâ€™s similar to a MWAA production image. This allows you to run a local Apache Airflow environment to develop and test DAGs, custom plugins, and dependencies before deploying to MWAA.
